# Start-Stop-System
A start-stop system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time the engine spends idling.   Long story short, When you "the player" Is Driving a Car or Motor and stops for 5 seconds ( Example: infront of a traffic light ) the Vehicle engine will turn off.  Start driving to turn engine on and start driving.
